\section{Goal(s) for the Platform from the End-User Perspective}

The goal of the ActivePro platform is to provide a user-friendly, all-in-one solution that helps professionals stay active by tracking daily activities, logging calories, maintaining a fitness journal, and receiving personalized workout plans. The app should leverage Artifical intelligence (AI) to allow users to ask questions and receive tips in real time. Additionally, it will integrate with social platforms, enabling users to connect with friends and family, create groups, and engage in fitness challenges for motivation and accountability.

\subsection{Opened-question responses}
\begin{itemize}
\item \bfseries{Q4. Do you wear any fitness watch? If yes, what features do you like or dislike about it?}
\end{itemize}

Most respondents wear fitness watches for style rather than fitness tracking, with step counting, heart rate monitoring, and sleep tracking as key valued features. However, users find the interfaces overwhelming and dislike the heavy reliance on mobile apps to track progress. Short battery life and mobile dependence, such as with Fitbit, are common frustrations. To improve user experience, fitness watches should feature a more intuitive interface, longer battery life, and better autonomy, reducing the need for constant phone syncing. Additionally, maintaining a stylish design while ensuring accuracy in fitness tracking remains a priority for users.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \bfseries{Q5. Do you use any fitness apps currently? If yes, which fitness app(s) do you use, and what features do you like or dislike about them?}
\end{itemize}


Most respondents donâ€™t use fitness apps regularly, as they find them too complicated and overwhelming due to excessive parameters and lack of customization to fit their specific needs. They appreciate features like step counting, calorie tracking, and training suggestions. However, apps like MyFitnessPal require users to purchase premium memberships for more personalized plans and advanced AI features, which many feel are too expensive, often costing more than a monthly gym membership. This limits their willingness to fully engage with these apps.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \bfseries{Q9. How much time can you realistically dedicate to fitness each day?
	}
\end{itemize}

Users are more likely to use a fitness app and dedciate their time consistently if it offers a user-friendly interface and meets their specific needs. The ability to create customized fitness routines and receive prompt answers to their queries is essential. Incorporating these features would motivate users to engage with the app daily, as it aligns with their preferences and provides tailored fitness solutions.

\section{A set of core tasks developed for your platform. Using your needs-and-requirements framework, conduct a hierarchical task analysis for each task. Present the task analysis as a diagram (e.g., using PowerPoint to create it) and ensure you are including functional and non-functional requirements. }
